# listing of tools for Molecular Modelling

This repository aims to list available tools and scripts that we developpe and used in our molecular modelling community and that we sometimes develop again because we jsut don't know someone already did it..  
This initiative cames to life during a diner-chat at the GGMM2023

## Drug Design
- screening protocol woth autodock-GPU and SMINA
## Molecular Duynamic Simulation
- clustering of molecular dynamic trajectory :
- TTClust: Gromacs Simulation Protocol with ligand parametrization : 
## CryoEM
- RSPFilter
- mrcCleaner
## Visualisation
- pymol (open source version) tutorial installation (Mac/Windows/Linux)
